## Data
- modelnet

## Quick Start
- prepare multi-view image
- train.py

## Evaluation
- eval.py

## Retrieval
- deep metric learning
- extract features by train.py
- prepare query/gallery sources

## TODO
- 

## Notice
- The network architecture used in our experiments is relatively shallow to 
allow for fast training and inference.
